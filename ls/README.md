## ls Command

The **`ls`** command is responsible for showing (listing) the files and directories within a specific directory.


## myls (Custom Clone)

`myls` is a basic clone of the `ls` command. It just shows the files within a specific directory.

### How to Use

  * After compiling the C code, running the following command will show the files in your **current directory**:

    ```bash
    ./myls
    ```

  * Running it with a path will show the files in that **specific directory**:

    ```bash
    ./myls ~/somedirectory
    ```
